## About The Project

![Screen Shot](./Screenshot.png)

This project is a website developed for Glovil Foundation, a non-profit organization based in India. The website showcases the foundation's mission to reinvent and rebuild the village ecosystem, one village at a time, while aligning with the Sustainable Development Goals and AtmaNirbhar Bharat.

Key Features:
- The website provides information about Glovil Foundation's four key areas of focus: education, health, livelihood, and environment.
- It highlights various programs and initiatives implemented by the foundation, such as The Glovil School, The Glovil Health Center, The Glovil Livelihood Program, and The Glovil Environment Program.
- Users can learn about the foundation's objectives, the impact of its work, and how they can get involved or support the cause.
- The website features a visually appealing design, incorporating HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap frameworks to ensure a responsive and user-friendly experience across different devices.

By documenting this project on GitHub, we aim to maintain a record of the website's development process, codebase, and version history. This documentation will serve as a valuable resource for future maintenance, collaboration, and improvements to the website. Developers and contributors can refer to this repository to understand the project structure, implement new features, fix issues, and suggest enhancements.

Through this GitHub repository, we encourage community participation, feedback, and collaboration to help Glovil Foundation achieve its goals of empowering rural communities, providing quality education, healthcare, livelihood opportunities, and preserving the environment. Together, we can make a positive impact and contribute to a more sustainable and self-reliant India.
